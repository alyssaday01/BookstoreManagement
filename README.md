# Bookstore Management
## Intro to Computer Science II: Project 1
## Coding Language: Java
This project was completed in an intro to computer science course in 2022.

The Bookstore Management System is a Java project that simulates the operations of a bookstore. It allows users to manage and purchase books, CDs, and DVDs and provides options for registering as a member, viewing the cart, and exiting the system. This project utilizes ArrayLists, object manipulation, complex methods, switch loops, and user input to create a functional bookstore management system.
The Bookstore Management System is designed to help manage a bookstore's inventory and provide customers with a convenient way to make purchases. It consists of the following main components:

## Key Concepts
- Main Class (Driver Class): The Main class serves as the entry point for the program and provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the system. Users can add specific book titles to the inventory, make purchases, and perform other bookstore-related operations.

- Bookstore Class: The Bookstore class acts as the cashier and is responsible for handling user transactions. It prompts users to choose from a menu of options, including completing a purchase, registering for membership, viewing the cart, and exiting the system.

- Objects (Book, CD, DVD): The system allows for the creation and storage of objects representing books, CDs, and DVDs. These objects are manipulated and added to the user's cart as they make purchases.

- Member Objects: Users have the option to register as members, which can influence the pricing of items or provide special offers. The membership status is managed by the system.

## Features
- Add Products: Users can add specific book titles to the book, CD, and DVD lists.

- Complete a Purchase: Users can add products to their cart, specify quantities, and complete the purchase. The system calculates the total price, applies any discounts for members, and updates the inventory accordingly.

- Membership Registration: Users can register as members to access special offers and discounts on purchases.

- View Cart: Users can view the contents of their shopping cart, including the items, quantities, and the total price.

- Exit Option: Users can gracefully exit the system.
